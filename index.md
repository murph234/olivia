Hi, I'm Olivia Smith, a junior at MIT with a passion for painting and mechanical engineering. I grew up in San Francisco, California and attended Lowell High School. Throughout high school, I was always driven to succeed academically and participated in many extracurricular activities. I was proud to be inducted into the National Honor Society and graduated as valedictorian of my class.

I was heavily involved in the arts during high school, participating in my school's art club and winning several awards for my paintings. Despite my success in the arts, I was also fascinated by science and engineering. I spent a lot of time tinkering with machines and taking apart electronics, always eager to understand how things worked.

This passion for both art and engineering eventually led me to apply to MIT. I was thrilled when I was accepted, and since then, I have been throwing myself into my studies and extracurricular activities with equal fervor. I am an active member of the mechanical engineering club and have even helped design and build a functioning robot as part of a class project.

In my free time, you can often find me in the art studio, where I continue to hone my skills as a painter. My ultimate goal is to use my knowledge and creativity to make a positive impact on the world. I dream of designing and building machines that not only function efficiently, but also look beautiful and inspire awe.

With my intelligence, drive, and passion, I am confident that I will achieve great things both at MIT and beyond. I can't wait to see where my journey takes me!
